# Scripts

## Live Translation
This will (try to) add the english text near every translation.
The script will re-translate every 5 seconds until you stop it. So it will translate also texts on new windows.

## Translation Files
This will open all GitHub files as table inside a window. Maybe the word in another language is easier to translate than the english word.
